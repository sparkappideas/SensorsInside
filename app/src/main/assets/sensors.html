    Most Commonly Used Sensors in Smarphones</h1>
<div>
    <strong>Proximity Sensor</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. It s comprised of an infrared LED and an IR light detector. It is placed near the earpiece of a phone, and for a good reason &ndash; when you place the handset up to your ear, the sensor lets the system know that you&#39;re most probably in a call and that the screen has to be turned off. The sensor works by shining a beam of invisible to humans infrared light which is reflected from a nearby object and picked up by the IR detector.</div>

<div>
    <strong>Light sensor</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    A phone&#39;s light sensor is what measures how bright the ambient light is. The phone&#39;s software uses this data to adjust the display&#39;s brightness automatically &ndash; when ambient light is plentiful, the screen&#39;s brightness is pumped up, and when it is dark, the display is dimmed down. An interesting fact is that high-end Samsung Galaxy phones use an advanced light sensor that can measure white, red, green, and blue light independently. And that&#39;s not overkill. In fact, the Adapt Display feature uses this data to fine tune image representation.</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <strong>Barometer</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    Higher-end phones have a built-in barometer &ndash; a sensor that can measure atmospheric pressure. Data measured by it is used to determine how high the device is above sea level, which in turn results in improved GPS accuracy.This sensor is really cool&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <strong>Magnetometer</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    The digital compass that&#39;s usually based on a sensor called magnetometer provides mobile phones with a simple orientation in relation to the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. As a result, your phone always knows which way is North so it can auto rotate your digital maps depending on your physical orientation.</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <strong>Hall Sensor</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    A Hall effect sensor is a transducer that varies its output voltage in response to a magnetic field. Hall effect sensors are used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications.</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    The main function of this proximity sensor is to detect how close your smartphone&#39;s screen is to your body. When you use your smartphone, it detects the position of ear with respect to screen and turns off the light of screen and saves battery. Also proximity sensor stops the accidental touch, unwanted input during talk. This sensor also detects the signal strength, interference sources and amplify or filter by use of Beam Forming Technique. Thus, in a nutshell, proximity sensor detect the presence of body like cheek, face or ear and stops the web surfing, music or video during talk/calling and save the battery. After the conversation, it resumes the same function which was stopped earlier during talk.Animated Hall effect</div>

<div>
    <strong>Accelerometers</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    Accelerometers (Gravity Sensors)are &nbsp;devices that can measure acceleration (the rate of change in velocity), &nbsp;but in smartphones, they&#39;re able to detect changes in orientation and &nbsp;tell the screen to rotate. Basically, it helps the phone know up from &nbsp;down.</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    All accelerometers have two fundamental parts:&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    1. A housing attachment to the object &nbsp;whose acceleration we want to measure.</div>
<div>
    2. A mass that, while tethered &nbsp;to the housing, can still move.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    For example assume a spring and a heavy ball. If you move the housing up, the ball lags behind stretching the spring. &nbsp;If we measure how much that spring stretches, we can calculate the force &nbsp;of gravity.</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    Inside the smartphone accelerometer chip, engineers have created a tiny accelerometer out of &nbsp;silicon. It has, of course, a housing that&#39;s fixed to the phone, and a &nbsp;comb-like section that can move back and forth. That&#39;s the seismic mass &nbsp;equivalent to the ball. The spring in this case is the flexibility of &nbsp;the thin silicon tethering to the housing. Now clearly, if we can &nbsp;measure the motion of this central section we can detect changes in &nbsp;orientation.</div>
<div>
    The motion of the springs causes a change in value of capacitance which is sensed by a sensor which scales it to current signals to communicate with the brain of the smartphone.</div>
<div>
    And all of this happens in a matter of a microseconds !! :P</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <strong>Gyroscope</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    The gyroscope is a sensor that can provide orientation information as well, but with greater precision. Thanks to this particular sensor, Android&#39;s Photo Sphere camera feature can tell how much a phone has been rotated and in which direction. It is also used by Google&#39;s Sky Map for telling what constellation you&#39;re pointing a phone at.</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <strong>Thermometer</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    Some folks might remember that the Samsung Galaxy S4 bragged with a thermometer for measuring ambient temperature. However, there&#39;s a thermometer in pretty much any smartphone, and some handsets might have more than one of them. The difference is that they&#39;re used to monitor the temperature inside the device and its battery. If a component is detected to be overheating, the system shuts itself down to prevent damage. And speaking of the Galaxy S4, it pioneered the use of an air humidity sensor in a smartphone. Data provided by it was used in the S Health application to tell whether or not the user was in their &quot;Comfort Zone&quot; &ndash; one with optimal air temperature and humidity.</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <strong>Sensor Availability</strong></div>
<div>
    &nbsp;</div>
<div>
    While sensor availability varies from device to device, it can also vary between Android versions. This is because the Android sensors have been introduced over the course of several platform releases. For example, many sensors were introduced in Android 1.5 (API Level 3), but some were not implemented and were not available for use until Android 2.3 (API Level 9). Likewise, several sensors were introduced in Android 2.3 (API Level 9) and Android 4.0 (API Level 14). Two sensors have been deprecated and replaced by newer, better sensors.</div>
<div>
    below Table &nbsp;summarizes the availability of each sensor on a platform-by-platform basis. Only four platforms are listed because those are the platforms that involved sensor changes. Sensors that are listed as deprecated are still available on subsequent platforms (provided the sensor is present on a device), which is in line with Android&#39;s forward compatibility policy.</div>
